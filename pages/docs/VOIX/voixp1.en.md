# Introduction to the VOICE Partner API


The API allows for the sending of [Voice SMS](sms-vocaux/sms_vocauxp1.md) or for making [deposits of messages directly on the answering machine.](message-vocal/message_vocalp3.md) These features are offered through the [Voice Partner](https://www.voicepartner.fr/) platform. From the website, you have immediate access to our free API: it allows you to easily integrate our voice services into your website, software, or CRM application.
